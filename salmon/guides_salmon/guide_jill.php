                            <p>Jill grew up in central Idaho, specifically near the Salmon River.  Her earliest memories are of playing in or riding on the river.  She spends all of her summer on the river and received her commercial certification as soon as she was able.  While she has had her license the shortest amount of time here at Salmon River Adventures, she has the most experience by far than any of our other guides.  Her exuberance and love for the river make her an ideal guide for anyone looking for an exciting river experience!</p>
