                            <p>Jason comes to Salmon River Adventures from Ilanz, Switzerland.  Born in Vancouver, Washington, Jason's family moved to Switzerland when he was a teen.  He discovered the Rhein river and fell in love with what is known as "Switzerland's Grand Canyon".  His family returned to the States a couple of years ago, and he followed not long after.  He has been certified with the International Rafting Federation for ten years, and is now certified as a commercial guide in Idaho.</p>
